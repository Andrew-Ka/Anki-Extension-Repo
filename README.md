# Anki Extension

For all Anki enthusiasts out there, or any normal people, I bring you another portal to the Anki Realm!
This is an Anki Extension (as the name suggests) to use on Chrome for making Cards/Notes while browsing the web.


## Getting Started

Using this Application is quite simple. 
1. ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóMAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE PREREQUISITES‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
2. Install the extension (you're in the right place) üòÅ

<br>

### Prerequisites

Requirements to use this extension correctly include 
- Having Anki on your PC. [Download Here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
- Logged in on Anki ü•∏
- Having the Foosoft AnkiConnect Add-on [Link Here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159)
    - Many don't have this extension yet, so here's a quick review of it:
      1. Open Anki (duh) üòè
      2. Click on "Tools" (top left)
      3. On the drop-down, click "Add-ons"
      4. On the new window that popped open, click "Get Add-ons..." (top right)üëÄ
      5. On the new window that popped open, enter the code "2055492159"
      6. Press "OK", restart Anki (close it out and open it again), and it should be set up! üòé
    - For more information about the Anki Connect API and Add-on, head over [here to Foosoft's Website (the developer)](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/)

### Installing

To install, clone this repository.
For my non-computer people, this is for you:
- Click the button that says "Code" (it's green, top right-ish)
- On the drop-down, click "Download Zip"
- Move it to wherever you want to, then unzipp it ü§ê

<br>

Now that you have it cloned, we need to add it to Chrome's extension panel. This requires Chrome to be in developer mode (since it's not on the Chrome Web Store ü•≤...yet).
- Open Chrome, Click the 3 Vertical Dots (top right), Click Extensions, then "Manage Extensions"
- At the top right, toggle developer mode   
We can now get the extension pulled up on Chrome
- Click "Load Unpacked" (top left)
- On the File Explorer Window that popped up, navigate to the location where you kept the unzipped folder and select that folder
-
